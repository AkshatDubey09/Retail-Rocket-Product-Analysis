# Retail Rocket: Product Conversion & User Behavior Analysis

### 📌 Project Goal
To analyze user clickstream data from a real-world e-commerce platform and identify bottlenecks in the "View-to-Transaction" conversion funnel.

### 📊 Key Insights
1.  **Top-of-Funnel Friction:** Only **2.3%** of product views result in an "Add to Cart" action, indicating a potential issue with Product Detail Page (PDP) engagement.
2.  **High Cart Abandonment:** **67.6%** of users who add items to their cart do not complete the purchase.
3.  **Impulse Buying Behavior:** **65%+** of all transactions occur within **15 minutes** of the user's first view. This suggests a user base driven by immediate needs rather than long-term research.

### 🛠 Tools Used
* **Power BI:** Built dynamic dashboards using DAX for Time Intelligence.
* **Power Query:** Handled ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) to convert Unix timestamps into readable Date/Time formats.
* **Data Modeling:** Created a Star Schema model linking Events to Product Dimensions.
